Ansible Builder
===============

Ansible Builder is a tool that aids in the creation of Execution Environments,
which are container images that serve as Ansible :term:`control nodes<Control node>`.

Using Ansible content that depends on non-default dependencies can be tricky.
Packages must be installed on each node, play nice with other software installed
on the host system, and kept in sync.
